## Welcome to OntoloBridge

**OntoloBridge is the bridge between regular users of controlled scientific vocabularies and the creators of the underlying ontologies.** 

Ontologies are sets of concepts and categories in a subject area or domain that show their properties and the relations between them.  OntoloBridge is built upon, and simultaneously validated by, three existing technologies: 
* BioAssay Express ([BAE](https://www.bioassayexpress.com)) from [CDD](https://www.collaborativedrug.com)
* Center for Expanded Data Annotation and Retrieval ([CEDAR](https://metadatacenter.org/)) workbench from [Stanford University](http://bmir.stanford.edu/)
* BioAssay Ontology ([BAO](https://bioportal.bioontology.org/ontologies/BAO))from the [University of Miami](http://pharmacology.med.miami.edu)

The OntoloBridge system will provide a semi-automated, convenient, rigorous process for researchers around the world to update and extend the BioAssay Ontology. The approach will be general and extensible to other ontologies. APIs and tools—including extensions to the CEDAR workbench—will be created that allow users to request new ontology terms or to make changes to existing terms easily during the annotation process using the BioAssay Express.

This effort emerged from recognition of the need to update and request ontology terms more easily while annotating BioAssay protocols. Experimental bioassay domain experts identified this need while working directly with CDD’s new annotation tool, [BioAssay Express](https://www.bioassayexpress.com).  BioAssay Express allows users to annotate their bioassays in a semi-automated and standardized fashion using reference ontologies such as the BioAssay Ontology ([BAO](https://bioportal.bioontology.org/ontologies/BAO)), Gene Ontology ([GO](http://geneontology.org/)), Cell Line Ontology ([CLO](https://bioportal.bioontology.org/ontologies/CLO)), and Disease Ontology ([DOID](https://disease-ontology.org/)) and many others. Bioassay Express is a machine learning annotation tool that provides automated annotation term suggestions while giving domain experts control over how their bioassay protocol is annotated. BioAssay Express helps researchers map vocabularies to the widely accepted standardized vocabularies provided by the ontologies. OntoloBridge in the future could help users of annotation technologies such as CEDAR (researchers performing curation, dedicated curators, IT specialists, ontology owners, and librarians and maintainers of data repositories) to easily request and update ontologies.

This grant is managed by multiple principal investigators—each with a well-defined and complementary area of expertise. The Schürer group (University of Miami, PI Dr. Stephan Schürer) will develop, maintain and expand the underlying ontologies and build infrastructure to support submission and processing of new terms. The Musen group (Stanford University, PI Dr. Mark Musen) as part of the CEDAR initiative will use their metadata framework for defining templates, enabling structured and consistent annotations. And Collaborative Drug Discovery (CDD, PI Dr. Barry Bunin) will create and maintain tools for annotating assays, and coordinate economical annotation of increasing amounts of public and private data.
